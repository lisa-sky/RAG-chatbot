# RAG-chatbot
A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application that lets users upload .txt and .pdf files, interact with content via a chat interface, and retrieve relevant info. Large files are chunked for efficient processing. Built with Docker, the app supports multiple document uploads, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS retrieval.
